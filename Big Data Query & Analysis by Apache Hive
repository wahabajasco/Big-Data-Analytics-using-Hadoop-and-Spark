#Task 2:  
Big Data Query & Analysis by Apache Hive
-----------------

This task is using Apache Hive for converting big raw data into useful information for the 
end users. To do so, 

--- Firstly understand the dataset carefully. 
--- Then, make at least 4 Hive queries (refer to the marking scheme). 
--- Apply appropriate visualization tools to present your findings numerically and graphically. Interpret shortly your findings.
--- Finally, take screenshot of your outcomes (e.g., tables and plots) together with the scripts/queries into the report.

Hive Queries
Query 1: 

SELECT srcip AS SourceIP,
SUM(spkts) AS Totalpacketreceived,
SUM(dpkts) AS Totalpacketsent,
COUNT(label) AS Numberofconnections
FROM UNSWNB15
GROUP BY srcip
ORDER BY srcip DESC
LIMIT 10;
